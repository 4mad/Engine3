TODO Conglomerate: (Add all TODOs here by section)

	ACCURACY OVERALL :
		1) Make it so that when doing vector = vector, small error can be taken into account. (Cut off imprecise digits? vector difference between error value?)
		2) Find alternative for Collision accuracy, (currently dependent on velocity of object) 

	COLLISION OVERALL:
		1) Find way to better resolve collision of objects with rotation (Object gets stuck inside other object due to rotation post collision) (path finding)
		2) Fix line segment generated from polygon side collision detection occasionally rendering from vertex into space instead of overlapping actual polygon side.

	LINE COLLISION:
		1)<X> Test out line collision against different geometries. 
		2)<X> Make line collision return not just points but lines too (if whole side collides).
		3)<X> Replace messy minLine to dist code with cleaner methods or variables?
	
	LINE SEGMENT COLLISINO:
		1) Make a line segment collision detection, currently only LINE collision exists.
		
	LINE GEOM OBJECT DEFINITION:
		1) Define a line object versus a Line segment in Geom 
			A) collisionGeom
			B)<X> renderGeom
	
	INPUT:
		1)<X> Create a keyboard input detector.
		2)<X> Make it register up down left right movements.
		
	Geom:
		1) <X>Make non "blind" collision methods for each specific case.
		2) <X>Make non "blind" renderGeom methods for each specific case.
